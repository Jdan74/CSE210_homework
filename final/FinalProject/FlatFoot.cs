One relatively easy way to see if you have a flat foot is to look at your went foot print after taking a shower. If your foot leaves a wet mark under arch, chances are your foot is somewhat flat.  A flat, or in medical terms, pronated foot might experience arch pain, ankle pain or sometimes knee or back pain.";
