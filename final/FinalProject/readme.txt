This program is inteded to help someone find the correct shoe for their Foot. 
It has 2 main menus including User and Admin.  The User is intended for the end user who 
would want to create a profile or find their previous profile, edit it, or find a shoe that
fits thier foot.
the admin side of the program is for backend managment such as loading and saving user and shoe lists,
adding, remove, editing shoes in the shoe database, displaying user lists, etc.
Ideally this admin side of the program should be password protected and track the administrators
but it was a out of the scope and timeline.
